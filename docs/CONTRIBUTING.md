# Contributing to Arturo
This project is a lovechild of mine. So, if you want to contribute, I would be extremely greatful. :)

*Contributing* could mean a few different things:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Adding to the official documentation
- Fixing my - possibly tons of - typos or grammar errors
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer
- Donations

**In a few words:** all contributions (even if they are just ideas or suggestions) are 100% welcome!

## An overview of the project

The project is mainly coded in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) - it's a very powerful, compiled language that transpiles to pure C. So, we pretty-much get the good parts of C without the associated headaches. There is also a good deal of C/C++ (mainly for external libraries and wrappers).

Mainly, it consists of 8 parts:

- The **parser**, that takes some source/text and converts it into a list of Arturo values
- The **evaluator**, that takes a parse block (^) and converts into a list of bytecode's
- The **execution** method, that takes some evaluated bytecode and execute it one-by-one
- The **helpers** (generally, useful methods that are to be used in different parts of the codebase)
- The **values** (the very core of Arturo)
- The **standard library**, written mostly in Nim & Arturo
- The **external libraries**, mostly written in Nim & C/C++
- The **main** wrapper that brings it all together and orchestrates the whole action

### Project structure

To get an initial idea of the project, here's a brief guide to where is what:

| Location | Description |
|---|---|
| `bin/` | The destination of the final binary after compilation |
| `examples/` | A list of working examples in Arturo |
| `src/` | The main source folder |
| `src/extras/` | 3rd party open-source code used by Arturo |
| `src/helpers/` | Useful helper methods grouped by category and used mostly by library functions |
| `src/library/` | The Arturo standard library functions, grouped by category |
| `src/system/` | Components of the Arturo binary, written in Arturo (the REPL, the packager, etc) |
| `src/vm/` | The Virtual Machine |
| `src/vm/bytecode.nim` | A list of all the VM bytecodes along with their description |
| `src/vm/env.nim` | VM Environment handling (paths, etc) |
| `src/vm/eval.nim` | The evaluator: where the parse tree turns into bytecode instructions |
| `src/vm/exec.nim` | The most important VM module, where the main loop is triggered |
| `src/vm/parse.nim` | The main lexer/parser: turning the initial input into a parse tree, of words, symbols and values |
| `src/vm/stack.nim` | Manipulation code for the different stacks used by the VM |
| `src/vm/value.nim` | The main Value object for our Virtual Machine along with numerous overloads, from initialization methods to printing and basic arithmetic |
| `src/arturo.nim` | The main entry; where all the magic begins |
| `tests/` | Different unit tests |
| `tools/` | Various tools, documentation generation, etc |
| `version/` | Main version & build numbers |

### The compiler

The main compiler is implemented as a Bytecode interpreter / Stack-based VM and should run in most architectures.

The main goals are: expressiveness, brevity, performance and portability. (With that exact order)

#### General schema

### Roadmap

The list of things to fix and/or add could be endless. But here is one, a bit prioritized (even though, inherently, incomplete and messy):

- [X] Add support for big number handling (via GMP)
- [ ] Enrich the system library
   - [X] Add built-in support for Databases (Sqlite, etc)
   - [X] Implement HTML module
   - [ ] Add more Server-related features
   - [ ] Implement LaTeX generation module
   - [ ] Add custom grammar parser functionality
- [ ] Optimize and refine the bytecode
- [ ] Improve VM performance
- [X] Add the option of saving intermediate bytecode
- [X] Add support for a package manager
- [ ] Add UI support (via libui? via webview? both?)
- [ ] Explore different uses of Arturo's dialecting capabilities (DSLs)
- [ ] Implement a basic Arturo compiler (written in Arturo :blush:)
- [ ] Go full self-hosted (that's an ambitious one, I know...)

## Contributing code

Anybody with an interest in programming languages, compiler design and/or some knowledge of Nim (it's not difficult to get an idea of what it is about once you see some code; trust me!) is more than welcome to contribute! So, how? 

Let's have a look!

### Pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase and are actively encouraged:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Licensing

In short: when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Reporting bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo/issues); it's that easy!

It's the best way to easily help the project grow: the more issues to solve, the better it will become!

### Notes for great bug reports

What we want in a *great* bug report:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Editing the documentation

Arturo's "official" documentation can be found [here](https://arturo-lang.io/documentation/). This doesn't mean you cannot contribute - quite the opposite actually. Feel free to fix any error you spot, correct spelling/grammar mistakes (= non-native project creator disclaimer! lol), add examples or even write whole new sections.

So, where do we start?

The documentation can be divided into 2 parts:

- Library reference
- Miscellaneous pages

### Library reference

Every single one of Arturo's built-in functions resides in one of the modules in the [src/library](../src/library) folder.

In each and every one of the files/modules, you can find a list of all the functions within that module. 

One example would `darken` from the [Colors module](../src/library/Colors.nim):

```nim
    builtin "darken",
        alias       = unaliased, 
        rule        = PrefixPrecedence,
        description = "darken color by given percentage (0.0-1.0)",
        args        = {
            "color"     : {ValueKind.Color},
            "percent"   : {Floating}
        },
        attrs       = NoAttrs,
        returns     = {ValueKind.Color},
        example     = """
            darken #red 0.2         ; => #CC0000
            darken #red 0.5         ; => #7F0000
            darken #9944CC 0.3      ; => #6B308F
        """:
            ##########################################################
            if x.kind == Literal:
                SetInPlace(newColor(alterColorValue(InPlace.l, y.f * (-1))))
            else:
                push newColor(alterColorValue(x.l, y.f * (-1)))
```

As you can see, the code includes different pieces of data (`description`, `args`, `example`, etc) along with its implementation. This data is exactly what is is - automatically - included in Arturo's library reference (and the `info` function as well). Once you see a couple of them, it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out how it all works!

### Miscellaneous pages

For all other pages in the official website (e.g. [this one](https://arturo-lang.io/documentation/language/)), all the content comes from templates that are then auto-magically (via Webize) converted to HTML.

So, if you want to edit one of these pages, just edit the corresponding template and your changes will be reflected at the very-next generation of the website (that part is up to me).

Here's where you can find all documentation template - all mostly written in a combination of Arturo itself and Markdown: [Documentation](../docs/website)

## Donations

Given that Arturo is written and maintained by people for free, in their own free time, that also have their daily jobs, any donation would give the project the help it needs to get to the next level. And for that, we'd also need you help.

So...
