    ; NOTES: 
    ; - to avoid repetition some tests may be not explicitly included
    ; - this test part tries to cover the most of possible behaviors,
    ;     including the possility of the Comparison module be rewritten, 
    ;     avoiding future broken changes
    ; - some combinations were not made, because it's considered very
    ;     improbable to happen, even with a future rewrite of 
    ;     the Comparison module
