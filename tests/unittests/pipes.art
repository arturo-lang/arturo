; A simple pipe
2 | print

; ...should be equivalent to:
print 2

; A tiny-bit more complicated pipe
2 | add 3 | print

; And a pipe split in different lines
2 | add 3
  | print

; ...should both be equivalent to:
print add 2 3

; Something even more complicated
["one" "two"] | map 'x -> upper x
              | print

; ...should be equivalent to:
print map ["one" "two"] 'x -> upper x

; Let's level up
1..10 | map 'x -> 2*x
      | print

; ...should be equivalent to:
print map 1..10 'x -> 2*x

; And a bit more
1..10 | map 'x [3*x]
      | select 'x [odd? x]
      | print

; ...should be equivalent to:
print select map 1..10 'x [3*x] 'x [odd? x]

; With assignment
z: 2 | add 3 | sub 1
print z

; ...should be equivalent to:
z: 2 | add 3
     | sub 1
print z

; ...and also to:
z: sub add 2 3 1
print z
