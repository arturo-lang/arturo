; Find stdlib functions with no documentation

; this script is meant to be run only with a DOCGEN build
; since it's the only one that contains data for the examples.
;
; So, first build like:
;  ./build.nims build docgen --as:arturo-docgen
;
; And then, run like:
;  arturo-docgen tools/nodocs.art

print "Standard library functions without documentation:"

loop symbols [k, v][
    details: info.get k
    if key? details 'example ->
        if zero? strip join.with:"\n" details\example ->
            print ["-" k]
]
